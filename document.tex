\section{Introduction}

Area detectors mounted on goniometer arms are commonly available for
powder-diffraction in lab-source diffractometer (for example Rigaku
HyPix-3000).
%The larger number of pixels trades-of the resolution for speed.
On the oposite this moving detector setup is rarely used at synchrotrons where
larger detectors are often prefered and kept fix during the whole acquisition.
The fixed position setup combined with the speed of modern detectors allows
easily the acquisition in kinetic mode for following chemical reaction or other
physical processes.

Nevertheless high-Q acquisition is needed for Pair-wise Distribution Function
(PDF) analysis which requires even larger detectors and higher energies to be
able to cover the Q-range with one single frame.
When speed is not a critical parameter, such experiment could be done with a
smaller detector mounted on a moving arm; this setup being commonly available
on most diffraction beamlines.

This document presents first the pyFAI library then how to merge multiple
diffraction images acquired at different positions with this library.
Then it explains how to calibrate the absolute position of every single
pixel in the detector as function of the parameter of the goniometer or of the
translation table.

\section{The fast azimuthal integration library}

PyFAI is a Python library used to tranform 2D diffraction images into 1D powder
diffraction pattern using rebinning of the pixel position to polar coordinates.
It provides in addition tools to calibrate the detector position, i.e. determine
where it is located in space from the ellipses drawn by the Debye-Scherrer cones
intersected by the detector (when used with a planar detector).
