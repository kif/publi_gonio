Dear Co-editor,

We would like to submit you a manuscript about data analysis of powder diffraction 
data acquired on synchrotron using area detector. This paper describes two new tools 
for the calibration of the detector position in X-ray scattering experiments. 
It contains also a few corrections on the pyFAI library which were not described yet.

First and foremost the new graphical user interface of pyFAI which aims at being 
simple to start with for first-time users. This feature has been the most requested 
one by ESRF scientists and represents 3 years of work of Valentin Valls solely 
focusing on the user experience.   

Then the document presents a new tool based on Jupyter notebooks to be able to calibrate 
the position of a detector mounted on a goniometer arm.   
This procedure requires some know-how in Python programming but open doors for 
high-Q measurement for beam-lines featuring only limited-size detectors. The procedure
has been validated with data from many beam-lines from two different synchrotrons. 
Links are provided for 4-examples, but only two are fully described in the manuscript.   
All 4 examples provided come with the reference dataset which should allow anybody 
(including the referee) to validate the code.

Since FIT2d's development has officially been discontinued by ESRF in favor of pyFAI,
the user interface described in this document is the de-facto standard at ESRF now. 
As the former publication of pyFAI, in 2015, reached hundred citations, it is likely 
the citation count of this document reaches the same level.

With my best regards,

Jerome Kieffer
