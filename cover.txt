Dear Co-editor,

We would like to submit you a manuscript about data analysis of powder diffraction 
data acquired on synchrotron using area detector. This paper describes two new tools 
for the calibration of the detector position in X-ray scattering experiments.
First and foremost the new graphical user interface of pyFAI which aims at being 
simple to start with for first-time users. Then a new tool based on Jupyter notebooks
to be able to calibrate the position of a detector mounted on a goniometer arm.   
This requires some know-how in Python programming but open doors for many 
beam-lines with limited credits and only small detectors. The procedure has been
validates with data from a couple of other beam-lines, in addition to the example 
described in the manuscript (ESRF-ID28 & D2AM CRG beamline).   

While pyFAI is an open source software, this very recent work is not yet part of 
any release of the software. We would like to provide you (and the reviewers) with 
the source of our work, if you wish to test or review our code.

For the graphical user interface:

For the goniometer calibration:
https://github.com/kif/pyFAI/tree/541_peak-picker

As this code in under review (mainly for cleaning-up), it shall be integrated in 
the main branch of pyFAI by the time of publication (and the text adapted accordingly).

As this manuscript contains quite a bit of programming, We would recommend you 
some reviewer which are used to the Python programming. There are quite a few of 
them in the Billinge group, for example Pavol Juhas is said to be a smart programmer.
At Petra-III, the powder diffraction beam-line has also a number of scientists
very fluent in Python. 
If you or any reviewer are interested in the raw data, we made them available at
